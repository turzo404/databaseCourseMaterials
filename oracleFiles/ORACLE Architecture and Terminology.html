<h1> ORACLE Architecture and Terminology </h1>
</center>

<hr size="6" align="centre">

<p>
This section will provide a basic understanding of ORACLE including the
concepts and terminology of the ORACLE Server. It is important that you
read through this section to familiarize yourself with the concepts and
terminology to be used throughout this manual. Most of the information
contained in this section is DIRECTLY extracted from ``ORACLE7 Server 
Concepts Manual'' and all credit should be attributed to ORACLE. 
</p>

<p>
Before you can begin to use ORACLE, you must have a basic understanding of
the architecture of ORACLE to help you start thinking about an ORACLE
database in the correct conceptual manner.
</p>

<p>
Figure 1 illustrates a typical variation of ORACLE's memory and process structures;
some of the memory structures and processes in this diagram are discussed in
the following section.  For more information on these memory structures and processes,
see page 1-15 of ``ORACLE7 Server Concepts Manual.''

<h2> <a name="section21"> Memory Structures and Processes </a> </h2>

<p>
     The mechanisms of ORACLE execute by using memory structures and
     processes. All memory structures exist in the main memory of the
     computers that constitute the database system. Processes are jobs
     or tasks that work in the memory of these computers.
</p>

<h3> <a name="section211"> Memory Structures </a> </h3>

<p>
	 ORACLE creates and uses memory structures to complete several jobs.
	 For example, memory is used to store program code being executed
	 and data that is shared among users. Several basic memory structures
	 are associated with ORACLE: the system global area (which includes
	 the database and redo log buffers, and the shared pool) and the 
	 program global area.
</p>

<p>
         System Global Area (SGA) is a shared memory region allocated by
	 ORACLE that contains data and control information for one ORACLE
	 instance.
</p>

<p>
	 An ORACLE instance contains the SGA and the background processes.
</p>

<p>
	 The SGA is allocated when an instance starts and deallocated when the 
	 instance shuts down. Each instance that is started has its own SGA.
</p>

<p>
	 The Program Global Area (PGA) is a memory buffer that contains data
	 and control information for a server process. A PGA is created by 
	 ORACLE when a server process is started. The information in a PGA
	 depends on the configuration of ORACLE.
</p>

<h3> <a name="section212"> Processes </a> </h3>

<p>
	 A process is a ``thread of control'' or a mechanism in an operating
	 system that can execute a series of steps. Some operating systems
	 use the terms job or task. An ORACLE database system has two general
	 types of processes: user processes and ORACLE processes.
</p>

<p>
	 A user process is created and maintained to execute the software code
	 of an application program (such as a PRO*C program) or an ORACLE tool
	 (such as SQL*PLUS). The user process also manages the communication
	 with the server processes. User processes communicate with the server
	 processes through the program interface.
</p>

<p>
	 ORACLE processes are called by other processes to perform functions
	 on behalf of the invoking process. ORACLE creates a server process
	 to handle requests from connected user processes. ORACLE also creates
	 a set of background processes for each instance (see ``ORACLE7 Server
	 Concepts Manual'' pages 1-18, 1-19).
</p>

<h2> <a name="section22"> Database Structures </a> </h2>

<p>
     The relational model has three major aspects:
</p>

<dl>
<dt> Structures 
</dt><dd> Structures are well-defined objects that store the
		data of a database. Structures and the data contained
		within them can be manipulated by operations.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Operations 
</dt><dd> Operations are clearly defined actions that allow
		users to manipulate the data and structures of a 
		database. The operations on a database must adhere
		to a pre-defined set of integrity rules.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Integrity Rule 
</dt><dd> Integrity rules are the laws that govern which
		operations are allowed on the data and structures
		of a database. Integrity rules protect the data and
		the structures of a database.
</dd></dl>

<p>
     An ORACLE database has both a physical and a logical structure. By 
     separating physical and logical database structure, the physical storage
     of data can be managed without affecting the access to logical storage
     structures.
</p>

<h3> <a name="section221"> Logical Database Structure </a> </h3>

         An ORACLE database's logical structure is determined by:

<ul>
<li> one or more tablespaces. 
<br>
<br>
</li><li> the database's schema objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes, clusters, sequences, stored procedures).
</li></ul>

<p>
         The logical storage structures, including tablespaces, segments, and
	 extents, dictate how the physical space of a database is used. The
	 schema objects and the relationships among them form the relational
	 design of a database.
</p>

<br>
<b>Tablespaces and Data Files </b>

<p>
	 Tablespaces are the primary logical storage structures of any ORACLE database.
	 The usable data of an ORACLE database is logically stored in the
	 tablespaces and physically stored in the data files associated with
	 the corresponding tablespace.  Figure 2 illustrates this relationship.
</p>

<p>
	 Although databases, tablespaces, data files, and segments are closely
	 related, they have important differences:
</p>

<br>
<dl>
<dt> databases and tablespaces
</dt><dd> An ORACLE database is comprised of one or more logical storage units
     called tablespaces. The  database's data is collectively stored in the
     database's tablespaces.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> tablespaces and data files
</dt><dd> Each tablespace in an ORACLE database is comprised of one or more
     operating system files called data files. A tablespace's data files
     physically store the associated database data on disk.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> databases and data files
</dt><dd> A database's data is collectively stored in the data files that
     constitute each tablespace of the database. For example, the simplest 
     ORACLE database would have one tablespace, with one data file. A more 
     complicated database might have three tablespaces, each comprised of 
     two data files (for a total of six data files).
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> schema objects, segments, and tablespaces
</dt><dd> When a schema object such as a table or index is created, its segment
     is created within a  designated tablespace in the database.  For
     example, suppose a table is created in a specific tablespace using the 
     CREATE TABLE command with the TABLESPACE option. The space for this 
     table's data segment is allocated in one or more of the data files that 
     constitute the specified tablespace. An object's segment allocates space 
     in only one tablespace of a database.

</dd></dl>
<br>

<img src="./ORACLE Architecture and Terminology_files/fig2.gif">
<h5 align="centre">Figure 2. Data Files and Tablespaces </h5>

<br>
<p>
	A database is divided into one or more logical storage units called
	tablespaces. A database administrator can use tablespaces to do the
	following:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Control disk space allocation for database data.
<br>
<br>
</li><li> Assign specific space quotas for database users.
<br>
<br>
</li><li> Control availability of data by taking individual tablespaces online or offline.
<br>
<br>
</li><li> Perform partial database backup or recovery operations.
<br>
<br>
</li><li> Allocate data storage across devices to improve performance.
</li></ul>

<p>
        Every ORACLE database contains a tablespace named SYSTEM, which is
	automatically created when the database is created. The SYSTEM 
	tablespace always contains the data dictionary tables for the entire
	database.  You can query these data dictionary tables to obtain 
        pertinent information about the database; for example, the names of 
        the tables that are owned by you or ones to which you have access.  
        See Chapter 3 for more information on how to access data dictionary 
        tables.
</p>

<p>
	Data files associated with a tablespace store all the database data in
	that tablespace. One or more datafiles form a logical unit of database
	storage called a tablespace. A data file can be associated with only
	one tablespace, and only one database.
</p>

<p>
	After a data file is initially created, the allocated disk space does
	not contain any data; however, the space is reserved to hold only the
	data for future segments of the associated tablespace - it cannot store
	any other program's data. As a segment (such as the data segment for a
	table) is created and grows in a tablespace, ORACLE uses the free space
	in the associated data files to allocate extents for the segment.
</p>

<p>
	The data in the segments of objects (data segments, index segments,
	rollback segments, and so on) in a tablespace are physically stored 
	in one or more of the data files that constitute the tablespace. Note
	that a schema object does not correspond to a specific data file;
	rather, a data file is a repository for the data of any object within
	a specific tablespace. The extents of a single segment can be allocated
	in one or more data files of a tablespace (see Figure 3); therefore, 
        an object can ``span'' one or more data files. The database 
        administrator and end-users cannot control which data file stores an 
        object.
</p>

<br>
<b> Data Blocks, Extents, and Segments </b>

<p>
ORACLE allocates database space for all data in a database. The units
of logical database allocations are data blocks, extents, and segments.
Figure 3 illustrates the relationships between these data structures.
</p>

<dl>
<dt> Data Blocks 
</dt><dd> At the finest level of granularity, an ORACLE database's data is stored 
     in data blocks (also called logical blocks, ORACLE blocks, or pages).  
     An ORACLE database uses and allocates free database space in ORACLE data 
     blocks.  Figure 4 illustrates a typical ORACLE data block.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Extents 
</dt><dd> The next level of logical database space is called an extent. An extent 
     is a specific number of contiguous data blocks that are allocated for 
     storing a specific type of information.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Segments 
</dt><dd> The level of logical database storage above an extent is called a 
     segment. A segment is a set of extents which have been allocated for a 
     specific type of data structure, and all are stored in the same 
     tablespace. For example, each table's data is stored in its own data 
     segment, while each index's data is stored in its own index segment.  
     ORACLE allocates space for segments in extents. Therefore, when the 
     existing extents of a segment are full, ORACLE allocates another extent 
     for that segment.  Because extents are allocated as needed, the extents 
     of a segment may or may not be contiguous on disk, and may or may not 
     span files. An extent cannot span files, though.
</dd></dl>

<img src="./ORACLE Architecture and Terminology_files/fig3.gif">
<h5 align="centre">Figure 3. The Relationship Among Segments, Extents and Data 
     Blocks </h5>

<p>
	ORACLE manages the storage space in the data files of a database in
	units called data blocks. A data block is the smallest unit of I/O used
	by a database. A data block corresponds to a block of physical bytes on
	disk, equal to the ORACLE data block size (specifically set when the
	database is created - 2048). This block size can differ from the 
        standard I/O block size of the operating system that executes ORACLE.
</p>

<p>
	The ORACLE block format is similar regardless of whether the data block
	contains table, index, or clustered data.  Figure 4 shows the format of 
        a data block.
</p>


<img src="./ORACLE Architecture and Terminology_files/fig4.gif">
<h5 align="centre">Figure 4. Data Block Format </h5>

<br>
<dl>
<dt> Header (Common and Variable)
</dt><dd> The header contains general block information, such as block address,
     segment type, such as data, index, or rollback. While some block overhead 
     is fixed in size (about 107 bytes), the total block overhead size is 
     variable.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Table Directory 
</dt><dd> The table directory portion of the block contains information about the 
     tables having rows in this block.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Row Directory 
</dt><dd> This portion of the block contains row information about the actual rows 
     in the block (including addresses for each row piece in the row data 
     area).  Once the space has been allocated in the row directory of a 
     block's header, this space is not reclaimed when the row is deleted.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Row Data 
</dt><dd> This portion of the block contains table or index data. Rows can span 
     blocks.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Free Space 
</dt><dd> Free space is used to insert new rows and for updates to rows that 
     require additional space (e.g., when a trailing null is updated to a 
     non-null value). Whether issued insertions actually occur in a given 
     data block is a function of the value for the space management parameter 
     PCTFREE and the amount of current free space in that data block.
<br>
<br>

</dd><dt> Space Used for Transaction Entries
</dt><dd> Data blocks allocated for the data segment of a table, cluster, or the 
     index segment of an index can also use free space for transaction entries.
</dd></dl>

<p></p>
	Two space management parameters, PCTFREE and PCTUSED, allow a developer
	to control the use of free space for inserts of and updates to the rows
	in data blocks. Both of these parameters can only be specified when 
	creating or altering tables and clusters (data segments). In addition,
	the storage parameter PCTFREE can also be specified when creating or
	altering indicies (index segments).
<p></p>

<p>
	The PCTFREE parameter is used to set the percentage of a block to be
	reserved (kept free) for possible updates to rows that already are
	contained in that block. For example, assume that you specify the 
	following parameter within a CREATE TABLE statement:
</p>

		pctfree 20

<p>
	This states that 20\% of each data block used for this table's data
	segment will be kept free and available for possible updates to the
	existing rows already within each block. 
</p>

<p>
	After a data block becomes full, as determined by PCTFREE, the block is
	not considered for the insertion of new rows until the percentage of
	the block being used falls below the parameter PCTUSED. Before this
	value is achieved, the free space of the data block can only be used for
	updates to rows already contained in the data block. For example, assume
	that you specify the following parameter within a CREATE TABLE
	statement:
</p>

		pctused 40

<p>
	In this case, a data block used for this table's data segment is not
	considered for the insertion of any new rows until the amount of used
	space in the blocks falls to 39\% or less (assuming that the block's 
        used space has previously reached PCTFREE).
</p>

<p>
	No matter what type, each segment in a database is created with at least
	one extent to hold its data. This extent is called the segment's initial
	extent. 
</p>

<p>
	If the data blocks of a segment's initial extent become full and more
	space is required to hold new data, ORACLE automatically allocates an
	incremental extent for that segment. An incremental extent is a 
	subsequent extent of the same or incremented size of the previous
	extent in that segment.
</p>

<p>
	Every non-clustered table in an ORACLE database has a single data 
	segment to hold all of its data. The data segment for a table is 
	indirectly created via the CREATE TABLE/SNAPSHOT command.
</p>

<p>
	Storage parameters for a table, snapshot, or cluster control the way
	that  a data segment's extents are allocated. Setting these storage
	parameters directly via the CREATE TABLE/SNAPSHOT/CLUSTER or ALTER
	TABLE/SNAPSHOT/CLUSTER commands affects the efficiency of data retrieval
	and storage for that data segment.
</p>

<p>
	For more information on Data Blocks, Segments and Extents, see ``ORACLE7
	Server Concepts Manual.''
</p>

<h3> <a name="section222"> Physical Database Structure </a> </h3>

<p>
An ORACLE database's physical structure is determined by the operating system 
files that constitute the database.  Each ORACLE database is comprised of 
these types of files: one or more data files, two or more redo log files, and 
one or more control files.  The files of a database provide the actual 
physical storage for database information.  For more information on these 
physical storage files, see ``ORACLE7 Server Concepts Manual.''
